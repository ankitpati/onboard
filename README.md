# OnBoard
This project provides web apps written purely in HTML, JS, and CSS, and optimised for use with projectors and large displays. The purpose is to ease the conduct of quizzes, MUNs, and the like, and reduce reliance on cluttered, cumbersome, and heavy general-purpose electronic presentation and board software.

## Platforms
All apps target

* Chrome/ium
* Firefox

They will work on

* WebKit
* Blink
* Gecko
based browsers.

None are tested on IE/Edge, and will never be. No IE/Edge specific code will ever be added or accepted. Code specific to some or all of the 2 listed browsers and 3 rendering engines will, however, be considered.

Some of the apps will be responsive, and can be used on all screen sizes.
